# gatsby-location-state-test

Passing state through @reach/router's `navigate` function works in Gatsby v2.8.8
but not in v2.9.0 (nor v2.9.4, the latest version at the time this test was created).

#### Run the headless Cypress test:

```sh
yarn test
```

#### Or, run the GUI Cypress test:

```sh
yarn test:gui
```
